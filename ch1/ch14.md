# 1.4 Merging Branches

## In practice:
In this section, we'll integrate work from `new-branch` back into `main`, exploring different merge strategies.

## Types of Merges
Understanding the different types of merges in Git is crucial for effective branch management.

### Fast-forward merge
This merge strategy is used when the target branch can be updated to point to the commit of the source branch without needing to create a new commit.

### Three-way merge
A three-way merge is used when the two branches have diverged and a new commit is required to reconcile the differences.

## Discussion: How do different merges work?

### Fast-forward merge
To merge two branches, we use `git merge <branch-name>` while in the branch we want to merge into. For a fast-forward merge:

```{code-cell} bash
git switch main
git merge new-branch
git status
git log
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
The `HEAD` of `main` is now pointing to the same commit as `new-branch`.
```

Switching branches may change the working directory, especially if they point to different commits.

## Exercise: Switching and Committing
```{code-cell} bash
git switch new-branch
touch file2.txt
echo -n "This is file 2." >> file2.txt
echo -en "\nThis is the fourth line." >> file1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "Add file2 and modify file1"
git switch main
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
The working directory content changes when switching branches.
```

Git prevents loss of work by disallowing branch switching with uncommitted changes.

## Exercise: Preventing Data Loss
```{code-cell} bash
git switch new-branch
echo -en "\nThis is the fifth line." >> file1.txt
git switch main
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
Git will not allow branch switching with uncommitted changes to protect against data loss.
```

## Note on Staging
Changes made after staging are not automatically included in the staged snapshot.

## Exercise: Staging and Modifying
```{code-cell} bash
git add file1.txt
echo -en "\nThis is the sixth line." >> file1.txt
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Add fifth and sixth lines to file1.txt"
```

## Viewing All Commits
```{code-cell} bash
git switch main
git log --all
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
Commits from `new-branch` are visible with `git log --all`, showing the comprehensive history across branches.
```

## Detached HEAD State
Exploring commits directly can lead to a detached HEAD state, which means you're no longer working on the tip of a branch.

## Creating and Switching Branches
Git offers shortcuts to create a new branch and switch to it in one operation, enhancing workflow efficiency.

```{code-cell} bash
git switch -c new-feature-branch
```

This chapter provides practical exercises to understand merging strategies, branch management, and Git's protections against data loss.
