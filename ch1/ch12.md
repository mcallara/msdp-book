# 1.2 Local repositories and commit

In this chapter, we will explore the creation of local repositories, the process of committing changes, and the significance of these actions.

## Creating a dummy project
If we want to learn about Git, we need a project to work with. Git can track changes in any type of files, it doesn't have to be code. So to keep it simple, we will create a dummy project, which will be just a directory with some text files in it.

### Test your knowledge
 - Create an empty directory for our project and  `my-project`.
 - Change into your project directory.
 - Verify the directory is empty and does not contain any hidden files.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["hide-input","remove-output"]
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
ls -a
```

## Initialize a repository
Initialize a new Git repository:

```{code-cell} bash
git init -b main
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
Notice the main branch is mentioned in the left bottom corner of Visual Studio Code (VSC).
```

**NOTE:** In VSC, the `.git` folder (along with some others) is hidden by default to avoid accidental changes. You can modify this behavior in the settings.

## Discussion: Main vs Master branch
From Git 2.28 onwards, the default branch name can be changed. This is how you set "main" as your default branch globally:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

Check the repository status:

```{code-cell} bash
git status
```

## Deleting the Git repository
Deleting the `.git` folder removes the repository:

```{code-cell} bash
rm -rf .git
```

If you try this command you will need to initialize the repository again with:

```{code-cell} bash
git init
```

## Exercise: Verify deletion
Check that the `.git` folder is now missing:

```{code-cell} bash
ls -a
```

## Discussion: Areas of Git
Exploring the `.git` folder and its subdirectories:

```{code-cell} bash
ls .git -a
ls .git/objects -a
```

## What is a commit?

### Exercise: Create a text file
Use the terminal to create a new file:

```{code-cell} bash
touch file1.txt
```

### Exercise: Edit the file
You can edit the file with VSC or directly from the terminal:

```{code-cell} bash
echo -n "This is file 1." >> file1.txt
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint 
In VSC, the file appears in the Explorer with a "U" symbol indicating it's untracked.
```

## The two steps of a commit
Add the file to the staging area and commit:

```{code-cell} bash
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Add file1.txt"
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint 
After adding, the file moves to the staging area. After committing, it's no longer marked with an "A" but is committed to the repository.
```

Check the repository status again:

```{code-cell} bash
git status
```

List the commits:

```{code-cell} bash
git log
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint 
The commit is now listed. Explore the `.git/objects` directory to see the objects created by Git.
```

```{code-cell} bash
ls -a .git/objects
```

## Summary
We covered creating a repository, adding and committing a file, and the significance of the `.git` and objects directories.
