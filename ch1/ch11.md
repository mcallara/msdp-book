# 1.1 Git and the Command Line

<<<<<<< HEAD
Before jumping into the world of Git, let's cover the essential of the command line. This section will introduce you to the command line and the basic commands you need to use Git.

## The Command Line

The command line is a powerful tool used to interact with your computer's operating system through commands. It allows you to perform tasks, manage files, and run programs without a graphical user interface.

### The prompt

When you open the command line, you are greeted by the prompt. It typically shows your current user and the host you're logged into, followed by the current directory. For example:
=======
## The terminal

The terminal is a powerful tool used to interact with your computer's operating system through commands. It allows you to perform tasks, manage files, and run programs without a graphical user interface.

## The prompt

When you open the terminal, you are greeted by the prompt. It typically shows your current user and the host you're logged into, followed by the current directory. For example:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```
root@debian:~#
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
This indicates that you are logged in as the `root` user on a host named `debian`, and you are currently in the root's home directory (`~`). The `#` symbol indicates that you are logged in as the root user. If you are logged in as a regular user, the prompt will end with a `$` symbol.

## Your first commands

First we need to check that Git is installed in our system, and as we will discuss later in the course, we would also like to know which version of Git we are using. To check if Git is intalled and which version we are using, we can use the following command:
=======
This indicates that you are logged in as the `root` user on a host named `debian`, and you are currently in the root's home directory (`~`).

## First command

Let's start with checking the version of Git installed on your system. Type the following command:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
git --version
```

## Commands: options and arguments

<<<<<<< HEAD
Commands can have options (shortened with a single dash `-` or full word with double dashes `--`) and arguments (values that the command acts on) to modify their behavior or specify what they should act on. For example, in the previous command, `--version` is an option that tells Git to display its version.

## Clearing the terminal
=======
Commands can have options (shortened with a single dash `-` or full word with double dashes `--`) and arguments to modify their behavior or specify what they should act on.

## Clear the terminal
>>>>>>> new-branch

To clear the terminal and get a clean screen, use:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [remove-output]
clear
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Creating a new directory

To create a new directory named `test`, use the `mkdir` command followed by the name of the directory you want to create. For example:

```{code-cell} bash
mkdir test
```

## Creating a new file

To create a new file named `hello.txt`, use the `touch` command followed by the name of the file you want to create. For example:

```{code-cell} bash
touch hello.txt
```

## Adding content to a file
To add content to a file, use the `echo` command followed by the content you want to add and the name of the file you want to add it to. For example, to add the text "Hello, world!" to the `hello.txt` file, use:

```{code-cell} bash
echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
```

## Displaying the content of a file

To display the content of a file, use the `cat` command followed by the name of the file you want to display. For example, to display the content of the `hello.txt` file, use:

```{code-cell} bash
cat hello.txt
```

## Navegating the File system
=======
## File system
>>>>>>> new-branch

To display the current directory you are in, use:

```{code-cell} bash
pwd
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
To list the files and directories in your current directory, use:
=======
## Viewing the content of directories

To list the files and directories in your current directory:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
ls
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
To include hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`) in the list, add the `-a` option to the `ls` command. For example, to list all files and directories in your current directory, use:
=======
To include hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`) in the list:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
ls -a
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
To get more information about the files and directories in your current directory, use the `-l` option. For example:

```{code-cell} bash
ls -l
```

To combine options, use them together. For example, to list all files and directories in your current directory with more information, use:

```{code-cell} bash
ls -la
```

To list all options available for a command you can frequeantly, use the `--help` option. For example, to list all options available for the `ls` command, use:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
ls --help
```

To change directory, use the `cd` command followed by the name of the directory you want to change to as an argument. For example, to change to the `test` directory, use:
=======
For help with `ls` command options:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
ls --help
```

## Creating folders

To create a new directory named `test`:

```{code-cell} bash
mkdir test
```

## Navigating the file system

To change directory:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
cd test
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint 
Note that the current directory in the prompt changed to reflect the new directory you are in and now it should look like this: `root@debian:~/test#`.
```

You can also confirm the current directory by using the `pwd` command again:
=======
Check your current directory again:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
pwd
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can use the `..` argument to go back one directory. For example, to go back to the previous directory, use:
=======
To go back one directory:
>>>>>>> new-branch

```{code-cell} bash
cd ..
```

## Configuring Git
<<<<<<< HEAD
Now that we have covered the basics of the command line, let's configure Git. The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your username and email address. This information will be used to identify your work.

To set your global username and email for Git:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global user.name "msdp-book"
git config --global user.email "msdp.book@gmail.com"
```
=======
>>>>>>> new-branch

To list your global Git configuration:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global --list
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
```{admonition} Know more: Sytem vs Global vs Local Configuration
:class: note
Git has three levels of configuration: system, global, and local. The system configuration applies to all users on the system and all repositories. The global configuration applies to the current user and all repositories. The local configuration applies to the current repository only. You can use the `--system`, `--global`, and `--local` options to specify which level of configuration you want to work with.
```

% teardown
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["remove-input","remove-output"]
cd ..
rm -r ch1
=======
To set your global username and email for Git:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global user.name "mcallara"
git config --global user.email "mcallara@gmail.com"
>>>>>>> new-branch
```
