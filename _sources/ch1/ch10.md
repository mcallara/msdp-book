# 1 Introduction to Version Control

It starts innocently with adding "final" to a filename, which soon turns into "final_final," and before you know it, you're staring at a folder full of files like "final_version_really_this_time.docx." If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. This chaotic approach to managing changes is not only messy but also risky, making it difficult to track your project's history and collaborate with others.

To solve this, we use **Version Control Systems (VCS)**. A VCS is a tool that helps you manage your project's history, allowing you to save "snapshots" of your work at any time. The ability to track versions and collaborate with others without mixing up work is a critical requirement for any modern software project.

This chapter introduces you to the fundamentals of version control using **Git**, the world's most popular version control system. We will guide you through using Git in three common environments:

* First, you will learn the essentials of Git from the **command line**, the foundation of all Git operations.
* Next, you will see how to use Git with a **graphical user interface (GUI)**, which provides a visual way to manage your work.
* Finally, you will learn to leverage a web-based platform like **GitLab** to collaborate and manage your projects online.

## What You'll Learn in This Chapter
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- **Create and manage** a Git repository to track your project's history.
- **Use essential Git commands** from the command line to save, retrieve, and compare different versions of your work.
- **Work with remote repositories** to collaborate with others and back up your work.
- **Recover from mistakes** by reverting to previous versions when something goes wrong.
