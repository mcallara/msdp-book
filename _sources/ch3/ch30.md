# 3 Testing and Test Driven Development (TDD)

Poll time. How does your development process look like? 
1. I don't test my code at all.
2. I implement some code and then I test it.
3. I create a test and then implement the code.

Why do we test our code? This chapter is not only about ensuring that your code works as expected, but also about a good process to achieve this.

Where should you start building a system? With stories you want to be able to tell about the finished system.
