Personal Experience: One of the things I like the most about AI assisted software development is the fact that it allows me to stay in the flow. I can focus on the problem I am trying to solve and let the AI take care of the syntax, the boilerplate code, remebering conventions, proposed solutions to simpler intermediate steps.

Real-world example:
Imagine that you are building a planning solution. The solution requires at some point to implement a function that given two time intervals, returns their intersection.

If you create the pseudo-code of you solution, then the AI will be able to help you with the implementation of the function.

# Test cases for a Function that given two time intervals, returns their intersection
```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-input]
def test_intersection():
    assert intersection((1, 3), (2, 4)) == (2, 3)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (4, 6)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (3, 6)) == (3, 3)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (1, 3)) == (1, 3)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (1, 2)) == (1, 2)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (2, 3)) == (2, 3)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (3, 3)) == (3, 3)
    assert intersection((1, 3), (4, 4)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (4, 5)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (5, 6)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (6, 7)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (7, 8)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (8, 9)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (9, 10)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (10, 11)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (11, 12)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (12, 13)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (13, 14)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (14, 15)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (15, 16)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (16, 17)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (17, 18)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (18, 19)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (19, 20)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (20, 21)) == None
    assert intersection((1, 3), (21, 22)) == None
    assert intersection
```

We see that the AI gets a bit repetitive. We can help it, suggesting variations of the test cases. 

what I wrote:
```{code-cell} python
print(intersection((3, 3), (2, 6))) # 
```
what the AI suggested:
```{code-cell} python
(3,3)
```

It is able to anticipate what the result will be.

# Function that given two time intervals, returns their intersection.
```{code-cell} python
:tags: [remove-input]
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    start = max(start1, start2)
    end = min(end1, end2)
    if start > end:
        return None
    return (start, end)
```
