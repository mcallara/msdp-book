# Automate Semantic Versioning in Poetry Projects with Python Semantic Release

Using `python-semantic-release` to automate semantic versioning in projects managed with Poetry on GitHub involves setting up `python-semantic-release` in your project, configuring it to work with Poetry, and automating the release process through GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with a Python project managed by Poetry.
- Basic understanding of semantic versioning, Git, and GitHub Actions.

## Setup Your Python Project with Poetry

Ensure your project is set up with Poetry and has a `pyproject.toml` file at its root. This file should define your project's dependencies and metadata. If your project isn't set up with Poetry yet, you can start by running:

```{code-block} bash
poetry init
```

And follow the prompts to create your `pyproject.toml`.

In this section, we will use the `poetry-demo` project.

```{code-cell} bash
poetry new poetry-demo
```

Navegate to the root folder of the project.

```{code-cell} bash
cd poetry-demo
```

## Change the Python Versions Supported by the Project

Since `python-semantic-release` requires `Python >=3.8`, before installing python-semantic-release, it is important that 
you check and change the Python version supported by the project.
In the `pyproject.toml` file, look for:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.7"
```

Change it to: 

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [remove-input]
sed -i 's/python = "^3.7"/python = "^3.8"/' pyproject.toml
```

## Install Python Semantic Release

Add `python-semantic-release` to your development dependencies using Poetry. This ensures that the semantic release process is part of your development workflow.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
poetry add --group dev python-semantic-release
```

## Configure Python Semantic Release

Create a configuration file for `python-semantic-release` in your project's root directory. You can either use a `.toml` file (e.g., `pyproject.toml`) or a `.semantic-release.toml` file for configuration.

If you're using `pyproject.toml`, add the following configuration under `[tool.semantic_release]`:

```toml
[tool.semantic_release]
version_variable = "pyproject.toml:version"
commit_version_number = true
upload_to_pypi = "false"
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [remove-input]
echo >> pyproject.toml
echo '[tool.semantic_release]' >> pyproject.toml
echo 'version_variable = "pyproject.toml:version"' >> pyproject.toml
echo 'commit_version_number = true' >> pyproject.toml
echo 'upload_to_pypi = "false"' >> pyproject.toml
```

## Setup GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment

To automate the release process, you'll use GitHub Actions. Create a `.github/workflows/release.yml` file in your repository with the following content:

```{code-block} yaml
name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency: release
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - name: Python Semantic Release
      run: |
        pip install python-semantic-release
        semantic-release version
        semantic-release publish
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [remove-input]
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
touch .github/workflows/release.yml
echo 'name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency: release
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    steps:
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: 3.11
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
    - name: Python Semantic Release
      run: |
        pip install python-semantic-release
        semantic-release version
        semantic-release publish
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' >> .github/workflows/release.yml
```
## Create a new repository 

Create a new empty repository in Github and name it `semver`.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["remove-input","remove-output"]
/home/callaram/.conda/envs/jupyterbook/bin/gh repo create semver --public
```

## Commit and Push Your Changes

After configuring everything, commit your changes (including the `pyproject.toml` modifications and GitHub Actions workflow) and push them to your GitHub repository.

```{code-cell} bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat(semver): Setup semantic release"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:mcallara/semver.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Make Semantic Commits

To ensure `python-semantic-release` correctly increments version numbers, use semantic commit messages (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) for your commits. This practice helps the tool to automatically determine the next version number based on the changes made.

## Conclusion

You've now set up your Poetry-managed project to automatically generate the right semantic version number for each release using `python-semantic-release` and GitHub Actions. This setup automates versioning and changelog generation, allowing you to focus more on development and less on release management.
