# 1.3 Branches

## Discussion: The Git Diagram
Understanding the structure and components of Git's internal management system is crucial for effective version control.

## Discussion: What are branches?
Branches in Git allow you to diverge from the main line of development and work independently without affecting the main line.

## Discussion: What are branches in Git?
Branches are essentially pointers to commits. The system uses a special pointer named `HEAD` to indicate the current branch you're working on.

```{code-cell} bash
git log
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
`HEAD` is pointing to the main branch.
```

Git keeps a file within `.git/refs/heads/` directory for each branch, specifying the commit each branch is pointing to.

```{code-cell} bash
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
`main` is pointing to the commit in which we added `file1.txt`.
```

## Exercise: Check the current Git status
```{code-cell} bash
git status
```

**NOTE:** Git tracks saved changes. Visual Studio Code (VSC) adds a dot to file names to indicate unsaved changes.

## Modified files in Git
Demonstrate modifying a file and observe Git's response.

```{code-cell} bash
echo -en "\nThis is the second line." >> file1.txt
git status
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
Git recognizes that `file1.txt` has been modified. In VSC, a `M` symbol indicates a modified file.
```

## Staging files from VSC
Utilize the Source Control tab in VSC to stage changes.

## Committing with VSC
Use the Source Control tab in VSC to commit changes.

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
The branch automatically moves to point to the latest commit.
```

```{code-cell} bash
git cat-file -p main
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
The commit keeps a pointer to its parent, linking the commit history.
```

## List local branches
```{code-cell} bash
git branch
```

## Create a new branch
```{code-cell} bash
git branch new-branch
ls .git/refs/heads
cat .git/refs/heads/new-branch
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
`new-branch` points to the same commit as `main`.
```

```{code-cell} bash
cat .git/HEAD
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
`HEAD` is still pointing to `main`.
```

## Switch to the new branch
```{code-cell} bash
git switch new-branch
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
VSC updates to reflect the change in the active branch.
```

## Discussion on Git Commands
Git provides multiple commands to achieve the same results, enhancing flexibility and user preference.

```{code-cell} bash
cat .git/HEAD
```

```{admonition} What to notice
:class: hint
`HEAD` now points to `new-branch`, and the `*` symbol in the branch listing indicates the current branch.
```

## Add a change to file1.txt in the new branch
```{code-cell} bash
echo -en "\nThis is the third line." >> file1.txt
git status
git add file1.txt
git commit -m "Add third line to file1.txt"
git log
```

## Summary
This section explored the concept of branches in Git, how to manage them, and their implications for project development.
