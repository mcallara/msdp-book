    "## Virtual Environment Management with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry provides robust tools for managing virtual environments, making it easier to maintain dependencies isolated from your global Python installation. This ensures that your project dependencies do not conflict with those of other projects or the global Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and Using Your Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a new project with Poetry or add dependencies to an existing project, Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for that project. This environment is where Poetry installs the project's dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Commands Within the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to run a single command within the context of your virtual environment without activating it, you can use `poetry run`. For example, to run a Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry run python my_script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activating the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the project's virtual environment, you can use the `poetry shell` command. This command spawns a new shell instance with the virtual environment activated, allowing you to run Python and other commands within the context of your project's dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuring Poetry to Store Virtual Environments Within the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Poetry stores virtual environments in a centralized location. However, you can configure Poetry to create the virtual environment within your project's directory by setting the `virtualenvs.in-project` configuration to `true`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration makes it easier to manage project environments, especially when working with version control systems or when you need to share the project with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Switching Between and Managing Multiple Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry allows you to manage multiple virtual environments for different Python versions or dependency configurations. Use the `poetry env use` command to switch between different Python interpreters or virtual environments associated with your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying and Listing Environment Information\n",
    "\n",
    "To view details about the current environment, including its location and Python version, you can use `poetry env info`. To list all environments associated with the project, use `poetry env list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Environments Associated with Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to remove a virtual environment managed by Poetry, you can use `poetry env remove` followed by the environment's name or Python executable path. This is useful for cleaning up or resetting your project's environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependency Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing dependencies is a critical part of Python project development, ensuring that your project has access to the necessary external libraries and specific versions thereof. Poetry simplifies this process through an intuitive set of commands and a `pyproject.toml` file for configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying Project Dependencies and Version Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies are specified in the `pyproject.toml` file under the `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` section. You can define the version constraints to ensure compatibility and stability of your project. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```toml\n",
    "[tool.poetry.dependencies]\n",
    "python = \"^3.8\"\n",
    "requests = \"^2.25.1\"\n",
    "flask = \"^1.1.2\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Dependencies and Dev Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a new dependency to your project, use the `poetry add` command. \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry add requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For development dependencies, which are not required in production, use `poetry add --dev`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry add --group dev pytest\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies Using `poetry install`\n",
    "\n",
    "Running `poetry install` in your project directory will install all specified dependencies. If a `poetry.lock` file exists, Poetry will install dependencies according to the versions listed there to ensure consistency across environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Differences Between Installing With and Without `poetry.lock`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **With `poetry.lock`**: Ensures that the exact versions of dependencies are installed, as specified in the lock file. This is critical for consistency and reproducibility across development, testing, and production environments.\n",
    "- **Without `poetry.lock`**: Poetry resolves dependencies based on the version constraints in `pyproject.toml` and generates a new `poetry.lock` file. This might lead to installing newer versions of dependencies than previously used if they still satisfy the specified constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Committing the `poetry.lock` File to Version Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Committing the `poetry.lock` file to your version control system is recommended. It locks the project to specific versions of dependencies, ensuring that other developers and environments use the exact same versions, thereby avoiding \"it works on my machine\" problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Dependencies to Their Latest Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "To update dependencies to their latest versions that still comply with the version constraints defined in `pyproject.toml`, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry update\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Dependencies Only Installations\n",
    "\n",
    "The current project is installed in editable mode by default. If you want to install the dependencies without installing the package itself, you can use the `poetry install --no-root` command. This is particularly useful for CI/CD environments where you might need the dependencies for testing or building the project but not the project package itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Poetry Virtual Environments with Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code (VS Code) has built-in support for Python development, including the detection and use of virtual environments. When you create a virtual environment in the root folder of your project, VS Code can automatically detect this environment and suggest it for use in the workspace. This seamless integration allows you to run and debug your Python code within the context of the project's virtual environment directly from the IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the detected virtual environment in VS Code, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Command+Shift+P on macOS).\n",
    "2. Type and select \"Python: Select Interpreter.\"\n",
    "3. Choose the virtual environment from the list. This environment will typically be located in your project's root directory and prefixed with `./.venv` or similar, indicating that it is the local environment created by Poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the virtual environment is selected, VS Code will use it for running and debugging your project's Python files. This ensures that you are working with the specific dependencies defined for your project, enhancing consistency and reliability during development.\n",
    "\n",
