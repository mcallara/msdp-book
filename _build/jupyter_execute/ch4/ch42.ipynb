    "Poetry is a tool designed to simplify the management of Python projects by handling dependency management and packaging in a unified way. Unlike traditional tools that require separate configurations for these tasks, Poetry uses a single `pyproject.toml` file for project specifications, making it easier to manage dependencies, package projects, and publish them to PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Poetry Over Traditional Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Poetry resolves dependencies more efficiently and accurately, avoiding the common issues of dependency hell.\n",
    "- **Unified Tool**: Combines features of dependency management and packaging tools into one, eliminating the need for multiple configuration files.\n",
    "- **Easy Version Management**: Allows specifying version constraints for dependencies in a straightforward manner and handles updates smoothly.\n",
    "- **Reproducible Builds**: The `poetry.lock` file ensures that your project can be reproduced exactly the same way on any machine.\n",
    "- **Intuitive CLI**: Offers an easy-to-use command-line interface for managing projects, dependencies, and virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up Your Project with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Poetry and Basic Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Poetry, run the following command in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can configure Poetry to suit your needs. For example, setting Poetry to create virtual environments within the project directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialising a New Project with Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new project is as simple as running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry new my-project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates a new directory called `my-project` with a basic project structure and a `pyproject.toml` file pre-configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting a Pre-existing Project to Use Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert an existing project to Poetry, navigate to the project's root directory and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "poetry init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive command will guide you through creating a `pyproject.toml` file for your project. You can specify dependencies and other project settings during this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of your Python project plays a crucial role in its maintainability, scalability, and ease of testing. Two common layouts are used in the Python ecosystem: the `src` layout and the flat layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding flat layout vs the `src` layout\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flat Layout**: This layout places the code that is intended to be importable ([the import package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/distribution-package-vs-import-package/#distribution-package-vs-import-package)) directly in the root directory of the project. While this is straightforward and commonly used in simple projects, it can lead to issues when the package tries to import itself, potentially mixing up the local code with installed versions from site-packages.\n",
