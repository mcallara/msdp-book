# 1.1 Git and the Command Line

## The terminal

The terminal is a powerful tool used to interact with your computer's operating system through commands. It allows you to perform tasks, manage files, and run programs without a graphical user interface.

## The prompt

When you open the terminal, you are greeted by the prompt. It typically shows your current user and the host you're logged into, followed by the current directory. For example:

```
root@debian:~#
```

This indicates that you are logged in as the `root` user on a host named `debian`, and you are currently in the root's home directory (`~`).

## First command

Let's start with checking the version of Git installed on your system. Type the following command:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
git --version
```

## Commands: options and arguments

Commands can have options (shortened with a single dash `-` or full word with double dashes `--`) and arguments to modify their behavior or specify what they should act on.

## Clear the terminal

To clear the terminal and get a clean screen, use:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [remove-output]
clear
```

## File system

To display the current directory you are in, use:

```{code-cell} bash
pwd
```

## Viewing the content of directories

To list the files and directories in your current directory:

```{code-cell} bash
ls
```

To include hidden files (those starting with a dot `.`) in the list:

```{code-cell} bash
ls -a
```

For help with `ls` command options:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: [scroll-output]
ls --help
```

## Creating folders

To create a new directory named `test`:

```{code-cell} bash
mkdir test
```

## Navigating the file system

To change directory:

```{code-cell} bash
cd test
```

Check your current directory again:

```{code-cell} bash
pwd
```

To go back one directory:

```{code-cell} bash
cd ..
```

## Configuring Git

To list your global Git configuration:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global --list
```

To set your global username and email for Git:

```{code-cell} bash
git config --global user.name "mcallara"
git config --global user.email "mcallara@gmail.com"
```
