# TODO
# - Multiplication - DONE
# - Sum between currencies
# - Side effects of multiplication - DONE
# - Equality - DONE
# Amount should be private

# Noticed that our design pattern (Value Object) implied an operation
# Tested for that operation
# Implemented it simply
# Didnâ€™t refactor immediately, but instead tested further
# Refactored to capture the two cases at once
# Next step: Test with private amount
def test_multiplication():
    # test that you can multiply a Dollar by a number and get the right amount.

    fifteen = five.times(multiplier=3)
    assert 15 == fifteen.amount
